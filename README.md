# Rainwater Monitoring System
This is a project that serves as a requirement for the completion of Embedded Systems. The purpose of this system is to monitor rainfall and water level for the collection of rainwater for environmental sustainability and water harvesting efficiency with the use of Blynk Console to display rain values, rain classification, water level in centimeters and rainfall regression and interpolation (numerical methods).
